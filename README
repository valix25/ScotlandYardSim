How to run the program:

I wrote the code in eclipse but I also managed to run it from terminal.
1. cd to_where_the_jar_file_is
2. $ java -jar VisScotlandYard.jar london.map 27 taxi bus subway
or just 
$ java -jar VisScotlandYard.jar london.map 27
( the last 4 arguments are part from a previous assignment and they don't matter for the current functionality)

I tried to incorporate a restart functionality, but when I tried be it with a button or menu item, the picture wouldn't be drawn anymore although the process would work in the console/standard input. The problem
was that I couldn't figure out why the picture/drawing dissapeared. If nothing is drawn try to run the program once more.

The rest of the implementation should work nice and smooth.
For further questions leave a message.
